  New results on the controversial, "impossible" EmDrive propulsion system could
  be soon published in a prestigious peer-reviewed scientific journal, according
  to credible rumors. "It is my understanding that Eaglework's new paper has
  been today accepted for publication in a peer-review journal, where it will be
  published," said high-reputation poster José Rodal , Ph.D, on the
  NasaSpaceFlight forum, which is often the primary source of updates for all
  things EmDrive.
